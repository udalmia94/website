									Since the challenge was to tube-launch a fixed-wing aircraft, and the tube size was specified, this directly put constraints
                  on the size of the wings. The wings had to be within span and chord limits that would allow it to fit in the launch tube.
                  Thus, selecting a good airfoil became paramount to the success of our UAV since a good airfoil would give more room for changes
                  in other aspects of the wing design (like span). <b>In order to select the airfoil, I came up with a selection process,
                  depicted in the flowchart, along with certain criteria that can be seen below.</b> Based on this selection process, the

                  <h6>Other aspects of the wing design were dictated by tube-size and manufacturing constraints. Details of the 3D wing
                    can be seen here.</h6>

									<p><span style="font-size:10pt;">XFLR5 & CFD Analysis</span><br>During the design and analysis phase it was important to
                    analyze the aerodynamic characteristics of the UAV so other sub-systems, especially controls, could work on their
                    design and use the correct aerodynamic properties of the aircraft. <b>XFLR5 was the primary analysis tool</b> used to determine
                    airfoil/wing performance in conditions that we expected the UAV to fly in. Multiple designs were tested before the final
                    design was selected. Despite the quick, and somewhat reliable lift estimates provided by XFLR5, it did not provide
                    reliable estimates of drag. Therefore, <b>I ran a CFD analysis of the final design simulating flow over different angles
                    of attack in order to determine the necessary aerodynamic coefficients.</b> Once again, I employed macros to increase my
                    productivity. A snapshot of one of the simulations can be seen below.</p>

                  <p><span style="font-size:10pt;">Tail Design (Individual Trade Study)</span><br>As part of the deliverables for the class
                    was an Individual Trade Study where each student would study the merits and demerits of a possible modification that could
                    improve the final design. Since our tail design was rather clumsy and bulky, I took up the study of trade-off between
                    different tail designs.<br>The original tail (pictured below) was made of wood and foam and needed a complex folding
                    mechanism for the stabilizers to fit in the launch tube. Instead of this I proposed attaching a boom to mount the
                    stabilizers giving us more room inside the tube to fit the vertical and horizontal stabilizers. A boom also gave us more
                    flexibility with changing the moment arm for the stabilizers without adding too much weight. <b>I plotted the weight vs
                    length of moment arm (that affects the volume coefficient, V<sub>V</sub>, in the graphs below) in order to evaluate the
                    designs.</b> From the plots, it's clear that there is a reduction in weight with the new design and therefore the new design
                    was implemented on the final aircraft. <b>Details of the analysis and its impact can be found in
                    <a href="IndividualTradeStudy.pdf" target="_newtab">this report</a>.</b></p>

                  <p><span style="font-size:10pt;">Equations of Motion for launch and constraint diagram</span><br>Since the launch section
                    of the flight profile is not common, we could not find the EOMs that would govern the vehicle dynamics in that phase of flight.
                    In order to be confident about our design, we decided to derive the EOMs and calculate the flight profile using MATLAB.
                    <b>I worked with a teammate, Daniel Ellinwood, to derive the EOMs and plot the flight profile that can be seen below.
                    This analysis enabled us to tweak our launch system to give us better ground clearance in the launch phase.</b><br>Earlier in the
                    design process I had performed a similar analysis to determine the power loading and wing loading constraints imposed by the
                    launch system.</p>

  								<h6>Estimated flight profile upon launch from tube calculated based on EOMs we derived.</h6>

                  <p>While these were my design contributions to the project, every member of the team was involved in the build
                    phase. Having worked with composite materials before (at Formula SAE), I lead the team's layups of fibre glass
                    on the foam wings. In the build phase I learnt a lot about dealing with other materials, and some of the practical aspects
                    of UAV building that I previously was not aware of. <b>When the UAV took flight, that was the most satisfying moment of my life
                    and reinforced my will to continue working as an engineer and to transform the world.</b></p>

                              Each semester, Purdue University School Aeronautics and Astronautics offers an Aircraft Design course, AAE 451, aimed to
                              expose students to aircraft design principles, emerging aerospace technologies, advanced manufacturing operations, and
                              variant aerospace platforms relevant to the aerospace industry today. During the fall semester especially, AAE 451
                              is oriented to explore small unmanned aircraft systems (SUAS) design and select low-altitude operations.
                              Each student is given the opportunity to explore and grow in fundamental aerospace disciplines (e.g. aerodynamics,
                              dynamics and controls, propulsion, structures) and project management to produce efficient aerospace products on-demand.<br>
                              Ujjwal was a student from the fall 2016 semester of AAE 451 and he exemplified high aptitude for design and project
                              management during team and individual assessments throughout the course. His team consisted of the most diverse students
                              in the class. Despite communication challenges, his team was able to produce the most innovative aircraft of the course.
                              Ujjwal and his teammates produced an aircraft consisting of a foamboard fuselage, fiberglass reinforced Styrofoam wings,
                              commercial-of-the-shelf (COTS) propulsion system [selected to design specifications], and 3-D printed mechanisms and parts.
                              Ujjwal and his teammates address the Request for Proposal (RFP) for the course to produce an aircraft with a deployable wing
                              capable of tube-launch operations. He and his teammates received satisfactory in majority of the deliverable categories and
                              was the only team of six teams total to achieve flight on the first day of testing. Ujjwal displayed great poise and leadership
                              to propel his team to achieve the highest marks of all teams participating in the RFP despite aircraft redesign due to
                              destruction during pre-flight.<br>Ujjwal, by the end of the course, became more proficient in aircraft design and project
                              management and is well-equipped to make a difference for any aerospace related organization in the future.<br>

                            <p style="font-size:11pt;">Ujjwal was a fantastic contributor to our senior design team. In particular,
                              his work on the aerodynamics of our tube-launched UAV was extremely thorough,
                              and he was able to present his analysis clearly in both formal and informal settings.
                              In addition to his technical contributions to the project, Ujjwal also greatly contributed
                              to the overall team experience with a positive attitude and willingness to help beyond his
                              own responsibilities. I will fondly remember all of the incredibly late nights that led
                              to the successful launch of our aircraft, and would jump at the chance to work with Ujjwal
